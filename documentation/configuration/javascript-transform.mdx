# JavaScript Transform

Use the power of Javascript to modify incoming event object, replace it with a completely new event or produce multiple events based on incoming data.<br/>
Also, you can use Transform to assign Data Warehouse specific SQL types for object fields, set the destination table name for each event or to skip the event altogether.
## Overview

<Hint>
Transform deprecates <a href="/docs/configuration/schema-and-mappings">Mappings</a>. Once Transform is enabled for a destination, all Mappings configs are ignored.
</Hint>

You can use modern javascript language features and built-in functions to transform an incoming event.
Jitsu puts incoming event as a global variable: `$`

Provided javascript must return:

 * **single object** - modified incoming event or completely new object 
 * **array of objects** - a single incoming event will result in multiple events in destinations 
 * **null** - to skip event from processing

To override the destination table, you need to add a special property `JITSU_TABLE_NAME` to the resulting events.

To override the destination SQL column type for a specific object field, you need to add an extra property with the special prefix `__sql_type_` added to the name of a field to resulting events. E.g.: `__sql_type_utc_time: "date"` sets SQL type **date** for column **utc_time**

## Server YAML configuration

Transform is controlled via `data_layout.transform_enabled` and `data_layout.transform` properties of **destination** object. <br/>

Example:
```yaml
destinations:
  example:
    type: google_analytics
    mode: stream
    data_layout:
      transform_enabled: true
      transform: |-
        const context = $.eventn_ctx || $

        return {
            ...$,
            dl: context.url,
            dh: context.doc_host,
            dp: context.doc_path,
            dt: context.page_title,
        }
```

## Modify incoming event

Javascript spread operator allows making a copy of an incoming event while applying some changes in just a few lines of code:

```javascript
return {...$,
    new_property: $.event_type
}
```
Add property to user object:

```javascript
return {...$,
    user: {...$.user, state: "active"}
}
```

## Build new event

Collect some user properties to the new object:

```javascript
return {
    properties: [
        {
            property: "email",
            value: $.user?.email
        },
        {
            property: "language",
            value: $.user_language
        }
    ]
}
```

Put an original event as a string payload:

```javascript
return {
    "event_type": "POST event",
    "payload": JSON.stringify($)
}
```

## Produce multiple events

Produce multiple purchase events from a single shopping cart event:

```javascript
if ($.event_type == "conversion" && $.products?.length > 0) {
    let results = []
    for (const product of $.products) {
        results.push({
            event_type: "purchase",
            product_id: product.id,
            price: product.price
        })
    }
    return results
} else {
    //skip events without any purchase
    return null
}
```

## Override destination table

Using Javascript spread operator:

```javascript
return {...$, JITSU_TABLE_NAME: "new_table_name"}
```

Conventional way:

```javascript
$.JITSU_TABLE_NAME = "new_table_name"
return $
```

## Override SQL column type

Set simple SQL types:

```javascript
return {...$, 
    event_date: $.utc_time,                               
    __sql_type_event_date: "date",
    event_time: $.utc_time,
    __sql_type_event_time: "time"
}
```
Sql types with extra parameters:

Some Data Warehouses support extra parameters for column types during table creation.
For such cases, Transform uses the following syntax to provide data type and column type separately:

```javascript
return {...$,
    title: $.page_title,
    __sql_type_title: ["varchar(256)", "varchar(256) encode zstd"]
}
```

## Predefined constants and functions

Transform comes with predefined constants: `destinationId` and `destinationType`
that can be used to enrich your data

```javascript
return {...$, 
    destination_id: destinationId,
    destination_type: destinationType,
}
```

Also `toSegment(event)` function is available to set up [Segment Compatibility](/docs/other-features/segment-compatibility):

```javascript
return toSegment($)
```
