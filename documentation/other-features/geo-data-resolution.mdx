# Geo Data resolution

**Jitsu** applies geo resolution during [enrichment](/docs/how-it-works/architecture#context-enrichment-step). Geo resolution means determining
user's country, city, zip code \(and other location data\) from their IP address. Here's a full list of fields we enrich from the IP address:

* continent
* country _\(two-letter country code\)_
* country_name _\(full country name)_
* region _\(two-letter state code for US\)_
* city
* latitude
* longitude
* zip
* autonomous_system_number
* autonomous_system_organization
* isp
* organization
* domain

<Hint>
  Please note, latitude and longitude are approximate. They are most likely the coordinates of the center of a city.

```json
{
  "location": {
    "continent": "North America",
    "country": "US",
    "country_name": "United States",
    "region": "NY",
    "city": "New York",
    "latitude": 40.7809,
    "longitude": -73.9502,
    "zip": "10128",
    "autonomous_system_number": 16509,
    "autonomous_system_organization": "AMAZON-02",
    "organization": "Amazon.com",
    "domain": "amazonaws.com"
  }
}
```

### MaxMind

**Jitsu** uses [MaxMind](https://www.maxmind.com/) databases for geo resolution. There are two families of MaxMind databases: `GeoIP2` and `GeoLite2`.

`GeoIP2` databases such as `GeoIP2-Country`, `GeoIP2-City`, `GeoIP2-ISP`, `GeoIP2-Domain` are paid geo databases. You can buy them all together or just anyone on [maxmind.com](https://www.maxmind.com/en/geoip2-databases).
After purchasing, you will receive a license key. Put obtained license key on Jitsu UI -> Geo data resolver section (available since 1.37.3 version) or run Jitsu with [env variable](#configuration).

`GeoLite2` databases such as `GeoLite2-Country`, `GeoLite2-City`, `GeoLite2-ASN` are free geo databases. For obtaining them you should just create a [free account](https://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/geolite2-free-geolocation-data) and generate a license key for using it on Jitsu UI or env variable `MAX_MIND_PATH`.

After setting MaxMind license key Jitsu downloads all available databases and uses them for enriching incoming events. For using a certain database add `?edition_id=<database type>` to MaxMind configuration. It is described in examples below.

<Hint>
  MaxMind license key is required for geo resolution. If it isn't configured - geo data won't be enriched into incoming events.
</Hint>


### Configuration

Configuration via env variable - add `MAX_MIND_PATH` env variable like: `MAX_MIND_PATH=maxmind://<your license key>` or add comma-separated certain edition ids `MAX_MIND_PATH=maxmind://<your license key>?edition_id=GeoIP2-City,GeoIP2-ISP`, or set your license key on Jitsu UI -> Geo data resolver section (available since 1.37.3 version).
If you use jitsucom/server, you can configure geo resolver via yaml configuration:

```yaml
server:
...

destinations:
...

#local file
geo.maxmind_path: path_to_file

#Jitsu will download all available MaxMind DBs from official MaxMind URL with your licence key
geo.maxmind_path: 'maxmind://<YOUR_MAXMIND_LICENSE_KEY>'

#Jitsu will download only GeoIP2-City and GeoIP2-ISP
geo.maxmind_path: 'maxmind://<YOUR_MAXMIND_LICENSE_KEY>?edition_id=GeoIP2-City,GeoIP2-ISP'

#hosted file
geo.maxmind_path: http://resource.url/path
